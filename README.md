# Final-Project
Its official name is "Python Python Revolution" because itâ€™s very similar to dance dance revolution just without the awesome graphics or a fourth option.
I used RFK/GREED for the base of this assignment as I felt it was the best fit for this game.
I originally had a fourth button (the down key), but the play testers said it was too hard to register the 4th direction, so I simplified it to 3.
The song is written by me.
